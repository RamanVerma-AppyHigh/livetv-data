We have strongly taken up the matter with the Russian government for early discharge of such Indian nationals. Strong action has been initiated against agents and unscrupulous elements who recruited them on false pretexts and promises. The CBI yesterday busted a major human trafficking network conducting searches in several cities and collecting incriminating evidence. A case of human trafficking has been registered against several agents.  We once again appeal to Indian nationals to not be swayed by offers made by agents for support jobs with the Russian Army. This is fraught with danger and risk to life. We remain committed to the early release of our nationals serving as support staff with the Russian Army and their eventual return home.\n\n#mea #ministryofexternalaffairs #mediabriefing #randhirjaiswal #russia #russiaukrainewar #israel #russiaukraineconflict #israelpalestineconflict #israelhamaswar #live \n\nSubscribe to Times Of India's Youtube channel here:\n http://goo.gl/WgIatu\n\nSocial Media Links: \nFacebook : https://www.facebook.com/TimesofIndia\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/timesofindia\nGoogle + : https://plus.google.com/u/0/+timesindia/posts", "platform_videoLink": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSUOq6224LM", "platform_viewsCount": 1645.0, "platform_likesCount": 8.0, "platform_dislikesCount": 0, "platform_commentsCount": 0.0, "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FSUOq6224LM/mqdefault.jpg", "imageList": ["https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FSUOq6224LM/default.jpg", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FSUOq6224LM/mqdefault.jpg", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FSUOq6224LM/hqdefault.jpg", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FSUOq6224LM/sddefault.jpg", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FSUOq6224LM/maxresdefault.jpg"], "platform_duration": "04:19:02"}, "short_video": false, "privacyStatus": "public", "embeddable": true, "isNative": true, "post_lang": "English", "self_liked": false, "self_disliked": false, "favourite": false}]
