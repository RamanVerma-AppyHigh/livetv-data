The gunmen were a part of the Telegram group, which has now been deleted and was famous in Tajikistan. The Russian communications watchdog has restricted access to 11 Telegram channels over 'terrorist content' in the two days following the March 22 Crocus city concert hall attack that left 143 people dead and nearly 100 missing. Meanwhile, one of the gunmen arrested by Russia has appealed against his pre-trial detention.
